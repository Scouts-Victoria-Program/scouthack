    "The most common way to refer to colours is by how they are made up. When it comes to colours, computers think in terms of red, green, and blue. By using different brightnesses of these three colours, we can make up most other colours. Each of these three colours can have a value between 0 and 255. So, for example, Cub Scout Yellow is 255 red, 201 green, and 12 blue. We can write this as `RGB(255, 201, 12)` (where RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue):\n",

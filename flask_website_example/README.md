# Simple Flask website

## Getting started

1. From the Flask Website folder, set up a Python virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  ```

2. Activate virtual environment:

  Note that you'll need to do this every time you open a new terminal.

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

  Note: If you need to deactivate the virtual environment in the current terminal, you can run `deactivate`

2. Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run app:

  ```bash
  ./website.py
  ```

4. Browse to http://localhost:5000
